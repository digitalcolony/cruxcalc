- ✅ localStorage persistence across all calculators
- ✅ Responsive design optimized for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Unit conversion system (Imperial/Metric)
- ✅ Real-time calculations with debounced updates

## Current Implementation Status

All 8 core calculators are now complete and functional:

- ✅ **BMI Calculator** - Body mass index with health categories
- ✅ **BMR Calculator** - Basal metabolic rate using multiple formulas
- ✅ **Body Fat Calculator** - Navy circumference method implementation
- ✅ **Heart Rate Zones Calculator** - Training zones with age-based max HR

- ✅ **Running Pace Calculator** - Distance/time/pace calculations

The application features a mature SharedValues system for cross-calculator data persistence, consistent neo-brutalist design, and responsive mobile-first layout.

## Technical Requirements (Standard for All Calculators)

### 1. Framework & Structure

- **Platform:** Astro 5.13.2 static site generation
- **File Structure:** `/src/pages/[calculator-name].astro`

### 2. Design System Compliance

- **Color Scheme:** Primary color with thick borders and bold shadows
- **Typography:** Bold, high-contrast text hierarchy
- **Layout:** Two-column grid (inputs left, results right)
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first design with breakpoints at 768px, 1024px
- **Components:** Consistent button styles, input controls, cards

### 3. Shared Functionality

- **Cross-Page Data:** Integration with `/public/sharedValues.js`
- **Age Synchronization:** Must sync age values with BMR/HR calculators
- **Local Storage:** Page-specific settings persistence
- **Navigation:** Header integration with short nav label

### 4. Input Standards

- **Range Sliders:** Custom-styled with thumb design matching existing
- **Toggle Buttons:** Gender/unit selection with active states
- **Validation:** Real-time input validation and error handling
- **Debounced Updates:** 100ms delay for smooth calculation updates

### 5. Results Display

- **Primary Metric:** Large, prominent display with units
- **Secondary Data:** Supporting calculations and comparisons
- **Explanatory Text:** Method descriptions and formulas used
- **Visual Indicators:** Progress bars, zones, or category displays where applicable

### 6. Information Architecture

- **Educational Content:** Info sections explaining the science/methodology
- **Practical Application:** How to use the results effectively
- **Limitations:** Accuracy disclaimers and method limitations
- **References:** Scientific backing or formula sources

## Implementation Summary

### Body Fat Calculator (Implemented)

The Body Fat Calculator is fully functional at `/body-fat` using the Navy circumference method. Features include:

- Gender-specific calculations (waist/neck for men, waist/neck/hips for women)
- Real-time calculations with debounced updates
- SharedValues integration for age, height, weight synchronization
- Imperial/metric unit support
- Body fat category classifications
- Responsive design matching the site's neo-brutalist aesthetic
- Input validation and error handling

**Key Implementation Notes:**

- Uses Navy circumference method only (as requested)
- Integrates with existing SharedValues system
- Maintains design system consistency
- Mobile-optimized measurement controls

### One Rep Max Calculator (Implemented)

The One Rep Max Calculator is fully functional at `/one-rep-max` with the following features:

- Three proven 1RM formulas (Epley, Brzycki, Lombardi)
- Weight and repetition sliders with real-time calculations
- Imperial/metric unit support with localStorage persistence
- Educational content explaining formula differences and usage
- Responsive design matching the site's design system
- Input validation and error handling

**Key Implementation Notes:**

- Standalone calculator (no SharedValues dependencies)
- Uses three complementary formulas for accuracy range
- Optimized for 3-6 rep range input (most accurate)
- Mobile-friendly slider controls

## Current Project Status
