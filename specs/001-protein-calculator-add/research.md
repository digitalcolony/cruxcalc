# Research: Protein Calculator

## Unknowns & Decisions

1. Pregnancy guidance

- Options: (a) 1.1 g/kg pre-pregnancy weight; (b) baseline RDA + 25 g/day
- Decision: Present both with short notes; mark one as "common practice" after citations finalized.

2. Longevity calories input

- Options: always-visible small numeric input vs. hidden behind toggle
- Decision: Use compact input with helper text; hide recommendation if empty.

3. Seniors cutoff behavior

- Options: Replace adult RDA at ≥65 vs show both
- Decision: Show both adult RDA and seniors range when ≥65 with a note; seniors highlighted.

4. Rounding/precision

- Options: Whole grams vs 0.1 g
- Decision: Whole grams for clarity; show ranges as integers.

5. Citations

- Action: Gather references for USA/Canada/UK RDAs; athletes; pregnancy; seniors; longevity percentage rationale.
- Decision: Include short source list in page copy.

## References (to confirm/finalize)

- USA RDA: 0.8 g/kg/day, general adults
- Canada RDA: 0.66–0.80 g/kg/day
- UK RDA: 0.75 g/kg/day
- Bodybuilding/Athletes: 1.6–2.2 g/kg/day (approx 1.0 g/lb)
- Pregnancy: 1.1 g/kg/day pre-pregnancy or baseline + 25 g/day
- Seniors 65+: 1.0–1.2 g/kg/day
- Longevity-focused: 10–15% of daily calories from protein; 4 kcal/g conversion

## Open Questions

- Confirm the final source links to display
- Confirm whether to include min/max for longevity (both 10% and 15%) or show a mid-point
