Casey Butt's Formula
One of the most widely accepted scientific approaches is Dr. Casey Butt’s empirical formula, which estimates your natural maximum lean body mass (LBM) based on four variables: height, wrist circumference, ankle circumference, and body fat percentage.

The Formula (Imperial Units):

Where:

M
M = Maximum potential lean body mass (in pounds)

H
H = Height (in inches)

W
W = Wrist circumference (in inches)

A
A = Ankle circumference (in inches)

F
F = Body fat percentage
